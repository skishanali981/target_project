  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be more fatal, such as SARS
      and COVID-19.
  utter_probiotics:
  - text: |
      No.there is currently no evidence to support the use of probiotics to help prevent or cure COVID-19.
      Probiotics and anti-biotics both are useless against covid19.
  utter_covid_19:
  - text: |
      COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, 
      following a report of a cluster of cases of 'viral pneumonia' in Wuhan, People's Republic of China.
      Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
      Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.
      In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
      For the latest information on COVID-19, check regularly on the WHO's coronavirus pages: 
      https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019

  utter_ppe_kit:
  - text: |
      Personal protective equipment is protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury or infection. 
      The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, biohazards, and airborne particulate matter.
      currently it is very effective against coronavirus spread.

  utter_vaccine_protocol:
  - text: |
      Vaccines are usually tested in adults first, and only later assessed in children when safety has been proven in adults, 
      because children are still developing and growing. 
      COVID-19 has also been a more serious and dangerous disease among older people. 
      Now that the vaccines have been determined to be safe for adults, they are being studied in children.
      you shoud not take vaccine only if-
      1) you are allergic to it
      2) children must not be given vaccine currently
      3) candidate must be 18+
      4) person has some severe complications related to lever and kidney

  utter_get_tested:
  - text: |
      Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.
      While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors' residences or long-term care facilities.

  utter_treatment:
  - text: |
      Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
      Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness. Read our dexamethasone Q&A for more information.
      Results from the WHO's Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.
      Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. Read our hydroxychloroquine Q&A for more information.
      WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes available.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
      \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
      \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
      \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
      \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
      \ is spreading from person-to-person and it is even Air Borne virus as well.\
      \ Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others.\
      \ That is why we recommend that these patients be isolated either in the hospital\
      \ or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer\
      \ pose a risk of infecting others.\nHow long someone is actively sick can vary\
      \ so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case\
      \ basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts,\
      \ and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation\
      \ including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory\
      \ testing for that patient.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading\
      \ easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected\
      \ geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the\
      \ virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became\
      \ infected."
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets and it is also air borne according to WHO. Before preparing
      or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water
      for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
      blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.This virus is not more resistant to heat than the usual viruses and bacteria found in food. 
      As recommended for good hygiene practice, foods should be thoroughly cooked to at least 70°C. 
      It is recommended to follow the WHO 5-Keys to Safer Food.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease.

    text: |-
      GAMMA: A mutation in the Gamma variant (P1) of coronavirus is linked to increased mortality, 
      a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and MIT researchers said on Wednesday.
      The mutation also carries greater transmissibility, higher infection rates, and increased 
      pathogenicity, showed the study detailed in the journal Genetic Epidemiology.
      The findings were based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methodology, which 
      analysed whole-genome sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 mortality data. 
      In September 2020, the team looked for links between each mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's 
      single-stranded RNA and mortality in 7,548 COVID-19 patients in Brazil.
      The researchers found one mutation—at locus 25,088bp in the virus's genome—that alters the spike protein 
      and was linked to a significant increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients. The team flagged the variant
      with this mutation, which was later identified as part of P1.

      1) Vaccine procurement must be done in an effective way
      2) Mass vaccination with robust speed is neccessary
      3) people around the world needs to be more aware and take all the precautions.
      4) heads of states must declare to prepare for the third wave.
      5) building oxygen plants around the nation with utmost pace.
      6) stop international travels
      7) increase vaccine production
